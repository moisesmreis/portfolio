# ðŸ“š My portfolio

This website is a single page application with a CTA with my name and location, some descriptions of tasks that I am able to do and the stack that I know how to use, it also comes with an timeline containing my work record up until now. In the future, I also intend to add some side projects. I used **Next.js** and **Vercel** to setup the application and development environment, and *Tailwind CSS* and *Flowbite* to create a useful UI.
